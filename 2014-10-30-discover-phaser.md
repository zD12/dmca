This is a DMCA takedown notice.

1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. I wrote a paid ebook called Discover Phaser, that you can buy here:
https://www.discoverphaser.com/

3. And the ebook is currently available for free on this github repo:
https://github.com/rbrander/Strike/blob/master/discover-phaser.pdf

4. To remedy the infringement, the discover-phaser.pdf file should be
removed from the public repo

5. My contact info: [private]

6. I don't know the contact information of the user brander

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

8. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Thanks,
