I am the original owner of SmartAdmin WebApp. I have built this webapp from scratch to be sold
exclusively on wrapbootstrap.com. It has been selling for over 10 months. If anyone is giving
them out for free (which is not allowed under any of the licenses) then it is affecting my sales
and business. I have found full copies of SmartAdmin assets sitting on public a repository, this is
strictly not allowed under any circumstances. Each day these assets sits on a public repository I
am having business loss.Provide information on which GitHub may contact you, including your email address, name,
telephone number and physical address.
