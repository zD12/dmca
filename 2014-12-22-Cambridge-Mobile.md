Dear GitHub Copyright Agent,

Yesterday, I sent you a request to remove proprietary and copyrighted
material belonging to Cambridge Mobile, Ltd. (“Cambridge”). It has been
27 hours, yet I have not heard back from you by any means. I have also
not heard any response from SVOX AG which has falsely attributed my
source code to themselves. I have not heard from any repository
maintainer. SVOX AG has included their address in the file: Baslerstr.
30, 8048 Zuerich, Switzerland.

The infringing material has not been removed from your service. I
remind you that federal law requires expeditious removal of the
infringing material or liability accrues for the failure to remove the
material. I renew my request that the proprietary and copyrighted
material belonging to Cambridge be removed.

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

[1] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a
person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular
section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to
as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

[2] I May Be Contacted At:

Name of Injured Party : Cambridge Mobile, Ltd.

Name and Title: [private]

Company: Cambridge Mobile, Ltd.

Address: 1323 Green Knolls Drive

City, State, and Zip: Buffalo Grove, IL 60089

Email address: sales@cambridgemobile.com

Telephone: [private]

[3] I have a good faith belief that the user-posted repositories
identified by the URLs below are unlawful because, among other issues,
the content constitutes unauthorized copying and distribution of
portions of Cambridge's World Bench, constitutes confidential
information, and a violation of the copyright. Although the file,
com_svox_picottsengine.cpp, bears an attribution to SVOX AG in
2008-2009, it contains copyrighted source code written years earlier by
me and assigned to Cambridge. I am the author of the claimed work and
no portion of this work was assigned or licensed to SVOX AG.
Accordingly, the content infringes Cambridge’s rights under the federal
copyright laws, including the DMCA and Copyright Act. I have read and
understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

[4] Reason:

Content Type: World Bench

Violation(s): Copyright Infringement

[5] Please act expeditiously to remove the content found at the
following repositories and related forks:
